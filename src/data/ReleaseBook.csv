9/2/2022,Utility,Secure,Falco,,,Scripting Language Execution below dev,"Scripts, such as shell or Python, are often used by attackers once on a compromised system. One way to hide these scripts is to place them in an uncommon directory where administrators may not check. The /dev directory is an example of these uncommon directories. If a script is found in the /dev directory, it should be investigated.

False Positive Chance: TBD (edited) ",Slack Link,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,
12/15/2022,Component,Platform,Agent,,,12.10.0,"Feature Enhancements
Support for Secure Light Mode
A new agent mode, secure_light, has been introduced to provide you with a limited set of secure features. The features that are supported in this mode are:

Runtime Policies
Activity Audit (only executed commands)
Captures
Sysdig agent running in secure_light mode consumes fewer resources than that of running in the secure mode.

For more information, see Secure Light.

Add Agent Configuration to Prevent Container Operations
A new agent-level configuration, ignore_container_action, has been added to prevent Sysdig agent from taking potentially disruptive container operations, such as kill, pause, stop, regardless of the policy.

To enable this option, add the following to the dragent.yaml file:

security:
  ignore_container_action: true
This configuration is disabled by default.

When the configuration is enabled and a policy instructs to do a container operation, the agent ignores the policy and creates an Info log message stating that agent did not take the action because of the configuration.

See also: Manage Threat Detection Policies | Containers

Improved Scope Matching
The scope matching for runtime policies has been improved by using equivalent container labels when corresponding kubernetes labels are temporarily not available.

The following settings determine the behavior. The example shows the default values.

security:
  use-container-labels-mapping: true
  container_labels_map:
    - ""kubernetes.pod.name: container.label.io.kubernetes.pod.name""
	- ""kubernetes.namespace.name: container.label.io.kubernetes.pod.namespace""
IMDSv2 Support on AWS Deployments
A new agent-level configuration, imds_version, should be set to 2 on all the deployments that require token-based communication with the AWS metadata service (IMDSv2).

imds_version: 2
To continue using the IMDSv1 style AWS metadata requests, leave the configuration unchanged or set it to 1.

imds_version: 1
Fix Vulnerabilities
Updated the Go version used for Promscrape to 1.18.7 to resolve CVEs.
Updated Jackson library to resolve CVE-2022-42003 and CVE-2022-42004
Upgraded snakeyaml to 1.32 in sdjagent to address CVE-2022-38752
Disable Checking Memory Consumption
Disabled the agent watchdog from checking memory consumption when running in Kubernetes since Kubernetes has its own resource management. If you wish to re-enable the agent watchdog to check memory consumption when running in Kubernetes, set the following config parameter:

watchdog:
   check_memory_for_k8s: true
Report Additional Labels for Cost Advisor
Modified the default Kubernetes label filters to allow collecting additional labels to identify the instance, region, zone, and the operating system of the nodes. The additional labels help calculating cost associated with your infrastructure.

Identify Delegated Agents
Added the statsd_dragent_subproc_cointerface_delegated metric to indicate whether the agent is delegated or not.

Improved Retrieval of Container Metadata
Improved fetching container metadata when both Docker and CRI runtimes are available. This reduces problems where runtime policy events have missing container information.

Known Issue
The YAML tab in Advisor in Sysdig Monitor that displays pod structure, similar to a kubectl describe operation, might not work as expected. Clicking the YAML tab can lead to an agent restart, and as a result, a temporary loss of metrics.

As a workaround, disable it in the dragent.yaml file as follows:


k8s_command:
    enabled: false
Defect Fixes
Report all Storage Classes
The agent now reports all the storage classes instead of just one. Earlier, the agent only sent one storage class from global_kubernetes in the metrics protobuf even when multiple storage classes exist in the cluster.

Match Group Name and User Name Appropriately in Events
Events now reports group.name and user.name correctly. This was caused by an issue where root ID being resolved as NA for containers in some cases.

Container Terminal Shell No Longer Returns N/A
Implemented container password and group lookup to prevent terminal shell in container returning N/A for the user.name.

Generate Command Execution Records for ARM
Fixed an issue with the activity audit where command execution records not being generated on ARM processor systems, for top-level processes executed within a container, and with no associated TTY.

Reports Labels Correctly on Pod Redeployment
Fixed an issue with promscrape where the agent would report the old pod UID when a pod is redeployed. This led to having all the labels missing from the timeseries scraped from that pod.

Fix JMX Monitoring on Newer JRE Versions
Fixed an issue where JMX monitoring did not work correctly on newer JRE versions due to sdjagent exceptions

The CloudFormation template serverless-instrumentation.yaml has been deprecated.

New Features
Serverless Patcher
The Serverless Agent 4.0.0 provides serverless-patcher, a new containerized template patcher that can run locally and be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

CloudFormation Template instrumentation.yaml
The Serverless Agent 4.0.0 provides instrumentation.yaml, a new CloudFormation template to deploy the automation to instrument (that is to patch) templates on Cloud.

SecretsManager Support for the Orchestrator Agent
Secrets like the Access Key and the Proxy Password can be now automatically fetched and provided to the orchestrator agent at deployment time.

Custom CA Certificates Support for the Orchestrator Agent
The orchestrator agent supports the uploading of custom CA certificates. That allows the SSL certificate verification of OnPrem backends and proxies.

Workload Agent Logs Fine-Tuning
Logs can be tuned and controlled at the fine-grained component level. This can avoid excessive logging from certain components, or enable extra logging from specific components for troubleshooting.

Defect Fixes
Runtime Instrumentation Exits
The runtime instrumentation exits when the main process exits, thus avoiding waiting other process to finish and keeping the container alive.

Renamed Parameter in CloudFormation Template orchestrator-agent.yaml
The Gateway parameter has been renamed to NetworkType in the CloudFormation template orchestrator-agent.yaml.

Exact Image Tags
The CloudFormation stacks uses exact tags now, instead of latest.

Redundant Wildcard Permissions
Redundant wildcard permissions have been removed from the TaskRole of the orchestrator-agent.

SIGINT/SIGTERM Propagation
The runtime instrumentation propagates SIGINT and SIGTERM signals to the instrumented workload now.

Honor Log Silent Mode in the Workload Agent
The `silent log mode prevents environment variables from being printed now.

List Separator to OptIn/OptOut Containers to be/from being Instrumented
Colons are now required as list separators to OptIn/OptOut containers. Commas are no longer supported.

Example
In the TaskDefinition, Tags can be leveraged to explicitly instrument some containers of the task, or prevent a bunch of them from being instrumented. For example, the following tag prevents myContainer1 and myContainer2 from being instrumented when the template patching runs in OptOut mode (default):

Tags:
  - Name: ""kilt-ignore-containers""
    Value: ""myContainer1:myContainer2""

Optimize Filtering
When using the Falco rules optimizer, remove the following redundant elements:
evt.type/evt.dir fields
evt.arg.res = 0 checks
When using the rules optimizer, remove the redundant container.id != host field from conditions while indexing.
Improved Drift Detection in Sysdig Secure
With agent 12.14.0, drift detection is improved in Sysdig Secure. Drift detection requires a minimum kernel version of 3.18 and drift prevention requires a minimum kernel version of 5.0.

For the drift feature (both detection and prevention) to work in the 12.14 agent release, set the following in:

The agent config file:

drift_killer:
        enabled: true
Helm, add:

--set agent.sysdig.settings.drift_killer.enabled=tru
Added Logging to Detect Incorrect Collector Endpoints
Added detection for invalid HTTP responses on connection.

Enabled Default Scraping of Docker Containers
Sysdig Agent now supports scraping Prometheus metrics from Docker containers by default. Scraping is based on container labels.

Dependencies
Add fmt Library: Added the fmt library to the Agent dependencies. The agent currently does not use this library.

Upgrade Library TBB: The TBB (Intel’s Threading Building Blocks) library has been upgraded to oneTBB v2021.8.0.

Upgrade Boost Library: The Boost library used by Sysdig Agent has been upgraded to v1.81.0.

Known Issues
Agent not compatible with GKE Autopilot running Kubernetes v1.26
Agent not compatible with Kernel v6.3
Defect Fixes
Restarting the Agent No Longer Causes Premature Process Termination
The SysV init script for RPM-based distributions now takes agent shutdown time into account, avoiding premature SIGKILL.

PID tracking is now enabled for systemd-sysv-generator.

Exclude JVM from Monitoring
Agent can now exclude some JVM’s from being monitored.

A set of exclusion rules can be defined in the Agent’s config. Each rule is a property/pattern pair: when the value of the given Java property matches the pattern, a process of that JVM is excluded from being monitored. For example, the following configuration will exclude OpenJ9-based JVMs from being monitored:

jmx:
  jvm_exclude:
    - property: java.vm.name
      pattern: .+OpenJ9.+
Previously, this functionality was hardcoded to reject OpenJ9, but this is no longer the case. If you observe heap dumps when monitoring OpenJ9, you should add the configuration above to your dragent.yaml.

Change Alerts help you detect when network traffic suddenly spikes or when the number of healthy nodes fall sharply.
Change Alerts assess a metric within a shorter time range and compare it to the same metric with a longer time range, providing a percentage-based value on the difference observed. In this way, disk usage over the last 5 minutes can be compared with disk usage over the last hour. The number of healthy Kubernetes nodes in the last 1 hour could also be compared to the number of healthy Kubernetes nodes in the last 8 hours.
avg(kubelet_volume_stats_used_bytes)  over 5m:1h
sum(kube_node_status_condition{condition=""Ready""}) over 1h:8h
Change Alerts have advantages over static threshold based alerts in the following scenarios.
Distributed infrastructure that has varying levels of traffic across different regions. In regions with significant activity, users may need to set different thresholds for their databases compared to regions with lower levels of traffic. With Change Alerts, users can simply be notified when there is a 20% decrease in database disk over the last 1 hour compared to the last 24 hours.
Static thresholds can be less useful when dealing with seasonal traffic patterns. In such cases, it may be more effective to focus on monitoring changes rather than relying on fixed thresholds.
Change Alerts is currently being deployed across all regions and will be available by end of next week in all regions.
For more information on when to use Change Alerts, please visit the docs. FAQs will be appended to the Change Alerts Internal FAQ .",Slack Link,NA,Coming Soon,Coming Soon,NA,Docs Link,Srikant,

In the following video, you can see 3 important improvements to the experience of writing a promql query:
When adding a label to a query, we are taking into account which metric are we filtering, so that we only prompt the autocomplete with relevant labels to that metric (previously we were showing all the labels in the system which users had to filter out). The same goes for the labels values, showing only the relevant label values for the selected metric.
We are not showing labels for cloud metrics (e.g. cloud_provider_* ) for every metric in the system. This was a legacy decision before we had cloud metrics written in Meerkat, and now with them being ingested, we can finally filter out and show only the labels that are relevant for a given metric. This increases the accuracy of our autocomplete and improves the UX for our users.
When writing a query in PromQl Query page, we are selecting all used labels from the query and automatically preselecting them and showing them in the table. This improves the UX, since writing a label in the query already expresses an intent from the user to further explore based on the used label.
These improvements have been release and are available to all the users, except IBM (because of the deployment freeze, will be available as soon as the freeze is lifted).",Slack Link,Video,Coming Soon,Coming Soon,,,Srikant,

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
Amazon Kinesis
Amazon RDS
Amazon SageMaker
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Network Firewall
AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

Sysdig Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE) Benchmark v1.1.0 - In collaboration with Mirantis, we have updated some of the audits in order to provide more accurate results.
AWS Well Architected Framework - The Well Architected Framework has been augmented with 26 new controls providing support for the recently added resource types, as well as for some of the already existing.
As a fundamental part of the support for Rancher Kubernetes Engine, Sysdig now provides the following new policy:
Sysdig Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2) Benchmark v1.6.0 - The hardening guide provides prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2, and this benchmark guide is meant to help you evaluate the level of security of the hardened cluster against each control in the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. It is to be used by RKE2 operators, security teams, auditors, and decision makers.

9/7/2023,Product Feature,Monitor,Costs,,,"Cost Advisor reaches GA, packed with new features","We’re excited to announce a significant milestone in our journey towards helping teams get visibility into, and optimize Kubernetes Costs. Cost Advisor is now generally available and we’ve made significant improvements.
Private Billing, currently available for AWS, reconciles costs with your specific AWS billing agreements. Usage of reserved and spot instances, as well as savings plans and other discounts will be used to calculate costs. This integration will be useful for customers that want more accurate costs instead of relying on public on-demand pricing.
We’ve added support for storage, load balancer, and idle costs. This paints a fuller picture of your Kubernetes costs where workloads are leveraging persistent volumes and load balancers, and idle costs gives platform teams insights into the cost of used cluster capacity – a great indicator as to whether a cluster can be reshaped or scaled down.
Cost Explorer empowers users to explore costs in detail with granular segmentation. This helps users understand, for example, what is the cost of a workload that is running across multiple clusters.
Cost Reports streamlines cost reporting processes with the ability to set up period report generation that can be exported to 3rd party systems, and Slack and email notifications help create a culture of cost discipline.
We’ve made improvements to workload rightsizing to give users more control over the recommendations provided. Depending on whether a workload is production / HA grade, or a staging / dev setup, when rightsizing a workload users can choose between more conservative or aggressive recommendations.

New header component that stays on top while scrolling with breadcrumbs on the left and actions on the right.
Added a Section component to separate logical parts of the page.
Adjusted the width of the pages to be more consistent.
Improved Dark mode color scheme.
Unification of the look of Settings pages across products.
Why?
Settings pages were haphazardly created with several disjointed flows and layouts - Page headers were different in Monitor and Secure, titles had different font sizes across pages, and various other inconsistencies.
As part of the high priority UI modernisation effort, the Settings pages were updated in both products and are now better looking than ever! Stefan Madzarevic made short work of converting the designs to code for the very large number of Settings pages we have.

Why?
Customers want to know where their infrastructure is most vulnerable so that they can mitigate exposure to cyber threats
They want to view all resources that share the same Vulnerability or Package so that they can understand the pervasiveness of the problem
They can prioritize the remediation of vulnerable resources by combining Risk Indicators such as In Use, Has Exploit, and Has Fix with Publicly Exposed.
Availability?
